# Overview

The Cluster API documentation is currently written in [Markdown][markdown]
and rendered into static HTML/CSS/JavaScript using [GitBook][gitbook] and various
[plugins][plugins]. It is automatically built using a [script](../../hack/build-gitbook.sh)
and continuously deployed using a shared Netlify account.

# Making changes

The GitBook source is located in [./docs/book](../../docs/book) and the static
content is generated into [./docs/book/_book](../../docs/book/_book) but not
checked into version control. Netlify will automatically rebuild the 
documentation on each merge to master.

## Submit a PR

## Testing with Netlify

Each PR to the cluster-api repository causes mutliple CI stages to be run. One
of the stages is named `deploy/netlify` and by clicking on the `Details` link
from the PR you can browse the generated content before it is deployed live.

## Testing locally

This has only been verified to work on OSX. For platform agnostic testing see
the [Testing with Netlify](#testing-with-netlify) section above.

```
make book
```

## Verify the contents of the GitBook are correct by viewing the pages which 
should include new or changed content and:

0) Ensuring the expected changes are there.
1) They are rendered as expected.

```
make serve-book
```

## Finally submit a PR

# Creating a new book

Each major and minor release should get a new version of the book. Netlify is
already configured to deploy each branch to a Netlify site at
`https://<branch-name-with-dashes>--kubernetes-sigs-cluster-api.netlify.com`.
Note that dots in the branch name will be replaced by dashes in the domain
name. For example, `release-0-1--kubernetes-sigs-cluster-api.netlify.com` is
the domain name for the branch named `release-0.1`. It remains to:

1) Create a subdomain for the branch. Subdomains are of the form
`<branch-name-with-dashes>.cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io`. To create one submit a PR
to the  kubernetes/k8s.io repository similar to this one:
https://github.com/kubernetes/k8s.io/pull/324

2) Request for the Netlify SSL cert to be extended to the new subdomain. For 
example:

Submit a request [here](https://www.netlify.com/support/) with the following
information:

Topic: SSL ISSUE
Site Name: kubernetes-sigs-cluster-api
Subject: Extend SSL certificate to new subdomain
How can we help you?:

>I am at step 4) "Contact Netlify Technical Support to get the SSL certificate extended to the new sub-domain." of [how to use Netlifyâ€™s branch deploy feature without Netlify DNS](https://community.netlify.com/t/common-issue-how-to-use-netlify-s-branch-deploy-feature-without-netlify-dns/128).
