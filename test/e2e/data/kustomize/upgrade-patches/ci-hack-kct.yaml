# Workaround for https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/issues/7457
# There is a small but important difference between these two:
# path: /a/b/c
# *creates* the c array, overwriting anything that was there before
# path: /a/b/c/-
# *adds* to the c array and does not work if the array is missing
#
# We add to the postKubeadmCommands (instead of pre*) since we need the CI artifacts
# script to run first. Without this, the container images are not imported properly.
