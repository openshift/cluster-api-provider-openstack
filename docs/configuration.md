# Required Configuration

To successfully run a Kubernetes cluster in OpenStack, you will need to configure a few essential properties. The following configurations are necessary:
  - public network
  - floating ip address
  - at least one of the supported operating system images
  - ssh authorized key

## Cluster Configuration YAML files

The cluster configuration file can be generated by using [`clusterctl config cluster`](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/user/quick-start.html#generating-the-cluster-configuration) command or by using one of the template files placed under `/template` directory. The file contain configuration on what OpenStack elements to use to create the cluster on, and which cluster components to create. However the template is incomplete and needs to be filled in. The following sections explain some more details about what can be configured.

## Public Network

The public network id can be obtained by using command,

```bash
openstack network show <public network name> | grep "\<id\>"
```
The ID must be expose as an environment variable `OPENSTACK_EXTERNAL_NETWORK_ID`

Note: If your openstack cluster does not already have a public network, you should contact your cloud service provider. We will not review how to troubleshoot this here.

## Floating IPs

You have to be able to at least assign floating IPs in your OpenStack. If you don't have rights 
to create floating IPs you have to make sure they already exist before creating the cluster. You can create one using,

```bash
openstack floating ip create <public network>
```
The IP must be exposed as an environment variable `OPENSTACK_CONTROLPLANE_IP`.

## Operating System Images

We currently depend on an update version of cloud-init otherwise the operating system choice is yours. The kubeadm bootstrap provider we're using also depends on some pre-installed software like a controller-runtime, kubelet, kubeadm, etc.. . For an examples how to build such an image take a look at [image-builder (openstack)](https://image-builder.sigs.k8s.io/capi/providers/openstack.html).

The image can be referenced by exposing it as an environment variable `OPENSTACK_IMAGE_NAME`.

## SSH Authorized Key

Openstack ssh keypair is required for the setup. This can be generated using command,

```bash
openstack keypair create <name>
```
The keypair must be exposed as an environment variable `OPENSTACK_SSH_AUTHORIZED_KEY`.

If you want to login to each machine by ssh, you have to configure security groups. If `spec.managedSecurityGroups` of `OpenStackCluster` set to true, two security groups will be created. One is `k8s-cluster-${NAMESPACE}-${CLUSTER_NAME}-secgroup-controlplane`, another is `k8s-cluster-${NAMESPACE}-${CLUSTER_NAME}-secgroup-worker`. These security group rules are following kubeadm's [Check required ports](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/install-kubeadm/#check-required-ports) so that each node can not be logged in through ssh by default. Please add existing security group allowing ssh port to `OpenStackMachineTemplate` spec. Here is an example:

```yaml
apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha3
kind: OpenStackMachineTemplate
metadata:
  name: ${CLUSTER_NAME}-control-plane
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      securityGroups:
      - name: k8s-cluster-${NAMESPACE}-${CLUSTER_NAME}-secgroup-controlplane
      - name: allow-ssh
```

## Network Filters

If you have a complex query that you want to use to lookup a network, then you can do this by using a network filter. More details about the filter can be found in [NetworkParam](../api/v1alpha3/types.go)

By using filters to look up a network, please note that it is possible to get multiple networks as a result. This should not be a problem, however please test your filters with `openstack network list` to be certain that it returns the networks you want. Please refer to the following usage example:

```yaml
apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha3
kind: OpenStackMachine
metadata:
  name: <cluster-name>-controlplane
  namespace: <cluster-name>
spec:
  networks:
  - filter:
      name: <network-name>
```

## Multiple Networks

You can specify multiple networks (or subnets) to connect your server to. To do this, simply add another entry in the networks array. The following example connects the server to 3 different networks:

```yaml
apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha3
kind: OpenStackMachine
metadata:
  name: <cluster-name>-controlplane
  namespace: <cluster-name>
spec:
  networks:
  - filters:
      name: myNetwork
      tags: myTag
  - uuid: your_network_id
  - subnet_id: your_subnet_id
```

## Subnet Filters

Rather than just using a network, you have the option of specifying a specific subnet to connect your server to. The following is an example of how to specify a specific subnet of a network to use for your server.

```yaml
apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha3
kind: OpenStackMachine
metadata:
  name: <cluster-name>-controlplane
  namespace: <cluster-name>
spec:
  networks:
  - filter:
      name: <network-name>
    subnets:
    - filter:
       name: <subnet-name>
```

## Tagging

By default, all resources will be tagged with the values: `clusterName` and `cluster-api-provider-openstack`. The minimum microversion of the nova api that you need to support server tagging is 2.52. If your cluster does not support this, then disable tagging servers by setting `disableServerTags: true` in `cluster.yaml`. By default, this value is false. If your cluster supports tagging servers, you have the ability to tag all resources created by the cluster in the `cluster.yaml` file. Here is an example how to configure tagging:

```yaml
apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha3
kind: OpenStackCluster
metadata:
  name: <cluster-name>
  namespace: <cluster-name>
spec:
  tags:
  - cluster-tag
```

To tag resources specific to a machine, add a value to the tags field in `controlplane.yaml` and `machinedeployment.yaml` like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha3
kind: OpenStackMachine
metadata:
  name: <cluster-name>-controlplane
  namespace: <cluster-name>
spec:
  tags:
  - machine-tag
```

## Metadata

Instead of tagging, you also have the option to add metadata to instances. This functionality should be more commonly available than tagging. Here is a usage example:

```yaml
apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha3
kind: OpenStackMachine
metadata:
  name: <cluster-name>-controlplane
  namespace: <cluster-name>
spec:
  serverMetadata:
    name: bob
    nickname: bobbert
```

# Optional Configuration

## Boot From Volume

1. For example in `examples/_out/controlplane.yaml` set `spec.rootVolume.diskSize` to something greater than `0` means boot from volume.

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha3
   kind: OpenStackMachine
   metadata:
     name: <cluster-name>-controlplane
     namespace: <cluster-name>
   spec:
     rootVolume:
       diskSize: 0
       sourceType: ""
       SourceUUID: ""
   ...
   ```

## Timeout settings

If creating servers in your OpenStack takes a long time, you can increase the timeout, by default it's 5 minutes. You can set it via the `CLUSTER_API_OPENSTACK_INSTANCE_CREATE_TIMEOUT` in your Cluster API Provider OpenStack controller deployment.

## Custom pod network CIDR

If `192.168.0.0/16` is already in use within your network, you must select a different pod network CIDR. You have to replace the CIDR `192.168.0.0/16` with your own in the generated example files: `addons.yaml` and `cluster.yaml`.
