# v1alpha5 compared to v1alpha6

## Migration

All users are encouraged to migrate their usage of the CAPO CRDs from older versions to `v1alpha6`. This includes yaml files and source code. As CAPO implements automatic conversions between the CRD versions, this migration can happen after installing the new CAPO release.

## API Changes

This only documents backwards incompatible changes. Fields that were added to v1alpha6 are not listed here.

### `OpenStackCluster`

### `OpenStackMachine`
